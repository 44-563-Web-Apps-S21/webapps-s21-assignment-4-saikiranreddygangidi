            Paris. The KING's palace . This is act 1 scene 2 
        </h5>


<p class="stage-direction">Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants</p>

<h6 class="name">KING</h6>

  <p class="speech king"> The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
    Have fought with equal fortune and continue
    A braving war.</p>

<h6 class="name">First Lord</h6>

    <p class="speech firstlord">So 'tis reported, sir.</p>

<h6 class="name">KING</h6>
<p class="speech king">
    Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
    A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
    With caution that the Florentine will move us
    For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
    Prejudicates the business and would seem
    To have us make denial.</p>


<h6 class="name">First Lord</h6>

 <p class="speech firstlord">   His love and wisdom,
    Approved so to your majesty, may plead
    For amplest credence.</p>


<h6 class="name">KING</h6>


    <p class="speech king">He hath arm'd our answer,
    And Florence is denied before he comes:
    Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
    The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
    To stand on either part.</p>

<h6 class="name">Second Lord</h6>

<p class="speech secondlord">It well may serve
    A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
    For breathing and exploit.</p>


<h6 class="name">KING</h6>

<p class="speech king">What's he comes here?</p>


<p class="stage-direction">Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</p>
    
<h6 class="name">First Lord</h6>


<p class="speech firstlord">It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
    Young Bertram.</p>


    <h6 class="name">KING</h6>

    <p class="speech king">Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
    Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
    Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
    Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.</p>
