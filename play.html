            Paris. The KING's palace . This is act 1 scene 2 
        </h5>


<p class="stage-direction">Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants</p>

<h6 class="name">KING</h6>

  <p class="speech king"> The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
    Have fought with equal fortune and continue
    A braving war.</p>

<h6 class="name">First Lord</h6>

    <p class="speech firstlord">So 'tis reported, sir.</p>

<h6 class="name">KING</h6>
<p class="speech king">
    Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
    A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
    With caution that the Florentine will move us
    For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
    Prejudicates the business and would seem
    To have us make denial.</p>


<h6 class="name">First Lord</h6>

 <p class="speech firstlord">   His love and wisdom,
    Approved so to your majesty, may plead
    For amplest credence.</p>


<h6 class="name">KING</h6>


    <p class="speech king">He hath arm'd our answer,
    And Florence is denied before he comes:
    Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
    The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
    To stand on either part.</p>

<h6 class="name">Second Lord</h6>

<p class="speech secondlord">It well may serve
    A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
    For breathing and exploit.</p>


<h6 class="name">KING</h6>

<p class="speech king">What's he comes here?</p>


<p class="stage-direction">Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</p>
    
<h6 class="name">First Lord</h6>


<p class="speech firstlord">It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
    Young Bertram.</p>


    <h6 class="name">KING</h6>

    <p class="speech king">Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
    Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
    Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
    Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.</p>

    <h6 class="name">BERTRAM</h6>

    <p class="speech bertram">My thanks and duty are your majesty's.</p>


    <h6 class="name">KING</h6>

    <p class="speech king">I would I had that corporal soundness now,
    As when thy father and myself in friendship
    First tried our soldiership! He did look far
    Into the service of the time and was
    Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
    But on us both did haggish age steal on
    And wore us out of act.: who were below him
    He used as creatures of another place
    And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
    Making them proud of his humility,
    In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
    Might be a copy to these younger times;
    Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
    But goers backward.</p>


    <h6 class="name">BERTRAM</h6>


    <p class="speech bertram">His good remembrance, sir,
    Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
    So in approof lives not his epitaph
    As in your royal speech.</p>


    <h6 class="name">KING</h6>


    <p class="speech king">Would I were with him! He would always say--
    Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
    He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
    To grow there and to bear, This he wish'd;
    I after him do after him wish too,
    Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
    I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
    To give some labourers room.</p>


    <h6 class="name">Second Lord</h6>
    
    <p class="speech secondlord">You are loved, sir:
    They that least lend it you shall lack you first.</p>


    <h6 class="name">KING</h6>


    <p class="speech king">I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
    Since the physician at your father's died?
    He was much famed.</p>


    <h6 class="name">BERTRAM</h6>


    <p class="speech bertram">Some six months since, my lord.


    <h6 class="name">KING</h6>

    <p class="speech king">If he were living, I would try him yet.
    Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
    With several applications; nature and sickness
    Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
    My son's no dearer.</p>

<h6 class="name">BERTRAM</h6>

<p class="speech bertram">Thank your majesty.
Exeunt. Flourish</p>
