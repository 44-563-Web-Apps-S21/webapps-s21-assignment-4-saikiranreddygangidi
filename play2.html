        <h6 class="name">KING</h6>
    
        <p class="speech king">I would I had that corporal soundness now,
        As when thy father and myself in friendship
        First tried our soldiership! He did look far
        Into the service of the time and was
        Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
        But on us both did haggish age steal on
        And wore us out of act.: who were below him
        He used as creatures of another place
        And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
        Making them proud of his humility,
        In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
        Might be a copy to these younger times;
        Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
        But goers backward.</p>
    
    
        <h6 class="name">BERTRAM</h6>
    
    
        <p class="speech bertram">His good remembrance, sir,
        Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
        So in approof lives not his epitaph
        As in your royal speech.</p>
    
    
        <h6 class="name">KING</h6>
    
    
        <p class="speech king">Would I were with him! He would always say--
        Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
        He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
        To grow there and to bear, This he wish'd;
        I after him do after him wish too,
        Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
        I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
        To give some labourers room.</p>
